Single Page App that uses The Open Movie Database (OMDb API)

Find about any movie in this neat little mobile web-app. Just type in the search and tap on the movie posters to learn more about your favourite movies.
If you see a kitten instead of a movie poster, then the poster isn't available and it loads a kitten via https://placekitten.com.
